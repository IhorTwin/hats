Her passion for making hats came from observing people's gradual loss of their uniqueness.<br\/>It was important for her to create something through which everyone could express self-confidence, and emphasize their individuality and status.<\/p><p><br\/>The hats she creates are not for everyone - that's an important statement that they are for those who share her vision. Lera herself is a shining example of how you can integrate hats into any look in everyday life\u2028and be confident about it.She fulfills the needs of people like her not only to attract attention, as a hat often attracts the attention of others but also to create comfortable designs. She pays special attention to the selection of materials to ensure that the hats are comfortable to wear.<\/p><p><br\/>All of her hats are handmade, requiring strong hands and constant work that sometimes results in burns.<br\/>“When I show clients my hats, they often don’t believe they are handmade, so I often show videos showing the entire creation process. I pay special attention to the interior finishing of the hats so that they are comfortable in any weather and last a long time.” <br\/>Valeria is an expert in her field, she knows everything about hats. Every detail of her work is the result of a professional approach and a great love for the products she creates.<br\/><\/p>",
